# Hopfield neural network
 
 A Hopfield network is a form of recurrent artificial neural network popularized by John Hopfield in 1982, but described earlier by Little in 1974.[1][2] Hopfield nets serve as content-addressable ("associative") memory systems with binary threshold nodes. They are guaranteed to converge to a local minimum and, therefore, may converge to a false pattern (wrong local minimum) rather than the stored pattern (expected local minimum)[citation needed]. Hopfield networks also provide a model for understanding human memory
